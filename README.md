# SpeedTest UI

A user interface has been designed with jetpack compose and kotlin.

I used canvas to draw a simulator to measure internet speed.

This UI has a simple logic to simulate a dynamic bar variant when pressing the "Start" button. You can also use the UiState class to change the value of MaxSpeed ​​to whatever you like or real logic.
